    <div id="sysAdminIntro">
      <h2>Intro to Systems Administration</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>A sysAdmin is what you think of when you think of the sterotypical "IT guy".</li>
        <li>Some of the necessary traits a sysAdmin needs to have is: <br>
          <ol>
            <li>good communication skills</li>
            <li>good customer service</li>
            <li>a familiarity with servers and client operating systems</li>
            <li>the ability to identify various problems</li>
            <li>a familiarity with virtual machines.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>The tools used as a sysAdmin varies a lot depending on what kind of operating system your company uses.</li>
        <li>A typical day for a sysAdmin starts early and ends late. Most of your day is resolving customer problems, however disaster preparedness is also a big part of the sysAdmin job.</li>
        <li>The sysAdmin job is one of the slowest growing jobs in the Cybersecurity field. This is because it is one of the oldest IT jobs, so it has been filled for the mot part, and there
            is no real hole that needs to be filled when it comes to the sysAdmin job.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div id="NetEngineerIntro">
      <h2>Intro to Network Engineering</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>A network engineer is someone who builds, maintains, and protects a company's network.</li>
        <li>A network is what all your company's computers are connected to. This allows them to access the internet and do everything that they need to do.</li>
        <li>Some of the key skills required to be a network engineer are:
          <ol>
            <li>good communication skills</li>
            <li>the ability to operate different networking equipment</li>
            <li>a familiarity with networking concepts, protocols, and network security methodologies</li>
            <li>the ability to analyze network traffic</li>
            <li>the knowledge of how to protect networks</li>
            <li>knowledge of laws, regulations, and standards</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Some of the tools that network engineers have been known to use are:
          <ol>
            <li>Wireshark, which is a tool that anayzes packets, or information that goes across your network</li>
            <li>Several commands in the operating system's command line</li>
            <li>Some kind of tool or website to test the network's bandwidth, which is how maximum speed of a network</li>
            <li>A IP calculator is something that more advanced network engineers can use to check if they are using the correct IP address</li>
            <li>puTTY is used for securing specific types of connections</li>
            <li>There are also several different tools that you can or will work with that will analyze network performance</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>A typical day for a network engineer includes:
          <ol>
            <li>reviewing logs, which is the process of analyzing network performance and traffic</li>
            <li>rebooting devices or servers</li>
            <li>fixing various issues brought to you by the sysAdmin</li>
            <li>performing backups of all your data, or checking that automated backups are working properly</li>
            <li>configuring different VPN's and ACL's (Access Control List)</li>
            <li>generating documentation of the things that are happening on your network</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>There are a lot of job prospects and openings for network engineers. Salary can vary a lot, but the average range is about $70,000 - $85,000.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div id="IncidentResponseIntro">
      <h2>Intro to Incident Response and Forensics</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>An incident responder is someone who is responsible for identifying and responding to incidents. There is a lot of overlap between an incident responder and a forensic investigator.
            Some incident responders do some or all of the forensic work needed to determine if any further action needs to be taken.
        </li>
        <li>An incident is generally, something that is abnormal. Normally incidents attempted breaches, but it could be copyright infringement, among many other possibilities.</li>
        <li>Some of the key skills necessary to be an incident responder include:
          <ol>
            <li>good communication skills</li>
            <li>a familiarity with networking concepts and protocols, and network security methodologies</li>
            <li>a vast knowledge on the possible cyber threats and vulnerabilities</li>
            <li>knowledge of the laws and regulations that you need to follow</li>
            <li>the ability to preserve evidence of the incident</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Some of the common tools used by incident responders are:
          <ol>
            <li>OSSM, which is a popular open-source tool from Alien Vault</li>
            <li>Snort, which is an intrusion detection system</li>
            <li>OpenVAS, which is a vulnerability scanner</li>
            <li>OCS Inventory, which allows you to keep track of your inventory, which includes routers, switches and wireless access points</li>
            <li>SIFT, which is a forensic tool from the SANS Institute, which is a packet of tools that allows you to perform forensic investigation</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>A typical day as an incident responder looks like:
          <ol>
            <li>performing risk assesments by doing vulnerability scanning</li>
            <li>monitoring, or getting alerted to abnormal behavior, or suspicious activity</li>
            <li>SOC Analyst</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>There aren't a ton of job prospects for incident response or forensic investigator, because it is a little niche to be working for law enforcement. Salaries can range a bit, but the
            average salary is around $99,000.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div id="PentestIntro">
      <h2>Intro to Offensive Security and Penetration Testing (Pentesting)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>A pentester is someone who is responsible for identifying security gaps and vulnerabilities by emulating threat actors.</li>
        <li>Pentesting is also known as White Hat hacking, which basically means that you are hacking for the benefit of the victim. White Hat hacking is a legal job that you can have
            that allows you to analyze the security threats posed to a company by acting as a bad hacker, or a Black Hat hacker.
        </li>
        <li>The key skills required to be a pentester include:
          <ol>
            <li>good communication skills</li>
            <li>a familiarity of network protocals and engineering</li>
            <li>a familiarity with different common operating systems</li>
            <li>the knowledge of vulnerabilities as well as the ability to develop new vulnerabilities</li>
            <li>good social engineering, or the ability to talk your way into certain things just using your personality</li>
            <li>knowledge of security standards</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Some of the tools that pentesters use are:
          <ol>
            <li>Kali, which is a operating system based off of Linux, that has a slew of tools to use</li>
            <li>Metasploit, which allows you to use exploits on known CVE's, or Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures</li>
            <li>Wireshark, which is a tool that analyzes packets, or information that goes across your network</li>
            <li>Zed Attack Proxy, which allows you to attack vulnerabilities in web applications</li>
            <li>Aircrack- ng, which is a tool that lets you crack into different WiFis</li>
            <li>Cain, which is a tool that allows you to crack a password</li>
            <li>There are so many tools that can help pentesters, but the key is to know what you need to do, and then you can search for the tool that can help you the most.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>A typical day as a pentester looks a little somethink like this:
          <ol>
            <li>A big part of pentesting is client meetings, where you can establish boundaries, find out what your target is, find out what the client hopes to get out of the pentest,
                and sign a whole bunch of paperwork
            </li>
            <li>Initial testing, where you can get a lay of the land and find out what you're working with</li>
            <li>Target attacks, where you can look for and dig into vulnerabilities, and use problem solving and critical thinking</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>There is a large demand for pentesters and people to work in offensive security. The salary can range a bit, but a lot of pentesters can end up making around $80,000.
