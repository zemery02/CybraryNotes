    <div id="partOne">
      <h2>Part One: Prerequisites</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The only prerequisites needed to start learning how to become a sysAdmin is, a computer, and very basic tech literacy.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div id="partTwo">
      <h2>Part Two: Titles, Skills, and Prospects</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The sysAdmin job can be operated on under many different job titles that include, but are not limited to:
          <ol>
            <li>Tech Support</li>
            <li>Database Administrator</li>
            <li>Network Administrator</li>
            <li>Security Administrator</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>A sysAdmin is someone who:
          <ol>
            <li>Determines the technical needs of the organization that they are working for.</li>
              <ul>
                <li>One thing to keep in mind as a sysAdmin, is that a lot of people are not as technically literate as you, so you shouldn't get frustrated when you try to explain a concept unique to your
                    job, to a client.
                </li>
                <li>This kind of goes hand-in-hand with the last point, but most organizations aren't aware of simple technical solutions. Your job is to identify the needs and solutions to
                    various technical problems.
                </li>
              </ul>
            <li value=2>Install, maintain, upgrade, and repair hardware and software</li>
              <ul>
                <li>After identifying a solution to a problem, you may need to download some new software to help you or your client with future tasks.</li>
                <li>After you've downloaded the software, it has now become your job to maintain the software, and attend to any updates or repairs needed.</li>
              </ul>
            <li>Evaluate and optimize performance, security, and survivablity</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Another part of your job will be to make sure that all your data is secure, and malicious actors can't steal or modify any confidential data.</li>
                <li>The best way to do this is to consistently back-up all of the company's data.</li>
                <li>One thing to keep in mind is the acronym CIANA, which stands for Confidentiality, Integrity, Authentication, Non-Repudation, and Availibility. Most of those things are pretty self-explanatory,
                    but what non-repudation means is that someone cannot deny that they did something they weren't supposed to.</li>
              </ul>
            <li>Create, manage, and train users</li>
              <ul>
                <li>sysAdmins are typically one of the first and last people to interact with an employee of a company. This is because they are the ones that need to set up the necessary
                    accounts, usernames, passwords and emails. They are also the ones to remove accounts when someone is fired or leaving the company in general. One of the biggest threats to a company is
                    insider information theft, and the removal of an account once someone is fired is a good way to thwart that threat.
                </li>
                <li>A big part of enforcing this point is to create separate accounts for each employee so that if something were to go wrong, or if information was stolen from the company, you could pinpoint
                    exactly who's computer was used to steal the information.
                </li>
                <li>Another point that has already been made, but is important to be reminded of, is the fact that people really don't understand technology. Especially the way that you might.</li>
              </ul>
            <li>Follow and enforce policies and regulations</li>
              <ul>
                <li>One of the jobs a sysAdmin is tasked with is enforcing rules that are generally skipped over when an employee signs the contract that gets them employed.
                    Things like social media blocking, VPN blocking, and general security are the main things that are enforced by a sysAdmin.
                </li>
                <li>Another part of this job is following the laws that pertain to the company's line of work.</li>
                <li>Some of the regulations that may need to be followed include consumer protection, data encryption, and data retention/destruction.</li>
              </ul>
            <li>Solve problems related to the items listed above</li>
              <ul>
                <li>The main job of a sysAdmin is to be a good problem solver.</li>
                <li>It's important to be able to think on your feet, be prepared for anything, as well as have the ability to stay calm during times of high stress,
                    whether it be from stupid questions you may get, to high stakes problems that can include loss of data, or insider theft.
                </li>

      <h2>Part Three: Salary and Job Prospects</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Typically a sysAdmin can find a job with almost any company. Some of the examples in the lesson include tech companies, finance and hospitals.
            For the most part a sysAdmin will be working in an office enviorment, but there are a couple exceptions.
        </li>
        <li>The typical way to become a sysAdmin is to aquire a degree that is related to a computer science degree. However, you can supplement a degree with experience, training, and knowledge.
            Some of the certifications that someone might need to become a sysAdmin is: A+, Network+, Sec+, and CCNA
        </li>
        <li>Salaries for a sysAdmin can vary widely, but an entry level job typically nets you somewhere around $50,000. Once you have experience though, you could be looking at somewhere between $70-90,000.</li>
        <li>While the sysAdmin job is one that has been around for quite some time, it is still a steadily growing field that has a lot of job openings.</li>
      </ul>

    <div id="partFour">
      <h2>Part Four: Tools</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>If you were to ask 10 sysAdmins what tools they used, you would receive 10 different answers.</li>
        <li>The tools a sysAdmin uses is heavily dependant on the operating system the company uses.</li>
        <li>Here's an in-depth look at some of the tools a sysAdmin can use with the Windows OS: </li>
        <ol>
          <li>Sysinternals is a suite of tools that can be of good use to a sysAdmin.</li>
          <li>The Windows Powershell is a tool that was built on top of the command prompt. It offers Linux commands, improved scripting, and many more upgrades.</li>
          <li>Wireshark is a tool that allows your to monitor all the data that is coming in and out of your network.</li>
          <li>Microsoft Management Console is Microsoft's tool that allows you to manage several tools and settings relevant to the sysAdmin job. One of the tools demonstrated allows you to create and manage a
              new user on a network or a local computer.
          </li>
