    <div id="partOne">
      <h2>Part One: Prerequisites</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The only prerequisites needed to start learning how to become a SOC analyst or forensic investigator, is a computer, and very basic tech literacy.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div id="partTwo">
      <h2>Part Two: Titles, Skills, and Prospects</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The 2 jobs that will be covered in this module are called a SOC analyst, and a forensic investigator.</li>
        <li>A SOC analyst's job responsibilities include, but are not limited to:
          <ol>
            <li>Monitor critical systems for security threats</li>
            <li>Analyze logs and reports to provide threat intelligence</li>
            <li>Perform Incident Respnse and triage</li>
            <li>Investigate security threats and breaches</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>A SOC analyst can work during any hours of the day. They can also be working an on-call shift, meaning if something happens, they have to drop what they're doing to go to work.</li>
        <li>A SOC analyst, Incident Responder, or a Forensic investigator can work on-site, meaning if something happens to a specific client, or a cybercrime happens in a distant city in your country,
            you could be asked to go to that location as part of your job.
        </li>
        <li>While the Forensic investigator's job is a little more steady, it can take a much longer time to complete the work on a case.
            This is because a SOC analyst or Incident responder's job is to be aware of breaches, and correct or recover missing or altered data. A Forensic investigator's job is to find out why the breach happened in the first place.
