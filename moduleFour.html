    <h1 style="text-align: center;">Module 4: Incident Response and Forensics</h1>
    <div id="partOne">
      <h2>Part One: Prerequisites</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The only prerequisites needed to start learning how to become a SOC analyst or forensic investigator, is a computer, and very basic tech literacy.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div id="partTwo">
      <h2>Part Two: Titles, Skills, and Prospects</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The 2 jobs that will be covered in this module are called a SOC analyst, and a forensic investigator.</li>
        <li>A SOC analyst's job responsibilities include, but are not limited to:
          <ol>
            <li>Monitor critical systems for security threats</li>
            <li>Analyze logs and reports to provide threat intelligence</li>
            <li>Perform Incident Respnse and triage</li>
            <li>Investigate security threats and breaches</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>A SOC analyst can work during any hours of the day. They can also be working an on-call shift, meaning if something happens, they have to drop what they're doing to go to work.</li>
        <li>A SOC analyst, Incident Responder, or a Forensic investigator can work on-site, meaning if something happens to a specific client, or a cybercrime happens in a distant city in your country,
            you could be asked to go to that location as part of your job.
        </li>
        <li>While the Forensic investigator's job is a little more steady, it can take a much longer time to complete the work on a case.
            This is because a SOC analyst or Incident responder's job is to be aware of breaches, and correct or recover missing or altered data. A Forensic investigator's job is to find out why the breach happened in the first place.
        </li>
        <li>Most SOC analysts have some form of bachelor's degree, but some emplyers might not find it necessary depending on past experience, and certifications</li>
        <li>Speaking of which, here are some of the certifications that might be useful to have in your pursuit of becoming a SOC analyst:
          <ol>
            <li>CySA+, which stands for Cybersecurity Security Analyst. This certification is from CompTIA</li>
            <li>CEH, which stands for Certified Ethical Hacker</li>
            <li>CHFI, which stands for Computer Hacking Forensic Investigator</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div id="partThree">
      <h2>Part Three: Salary and Job Prospects</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Salary can vary a lot depending on the actual job you are doing, wheter it be an Incident Responder, a Forensic Investigator, or a SOC Analyst. Entry-level salary is about $45,000,
              but the typical range is about $45-99,000. Some people with experience can make up to, or over $120,000.
          </li>
          <li>The prospects for jobs also really depends on the job role that you are given. Growth for these jobs is somewhere between 8%-20% year-over-year growth.</li>
          <li>There is a relatively small overall market for these jobs, that ranges somewhere between 100,000 - 200,000 jobs.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Part Four: Tools</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Some of the tools you may use on a day-to-day basis as a SOC analyst, incident responder, or forensic investigator include but are not limited to:
          <ol>
            <li>Hex editors, which allow you to break open the hex of a file to see if the is any malicious code inside</li>
            <li>Forensic Toolkits, which allow you to forensic work on a breach to see what went wrong</li>
            <li>SIEMS, which allows you to make sense of a malicious attack</li>
            <li>Threat Intelligence tools, which also allow you to figure out what went wrong during an incident</li>
            <li>Reporting Mechanisms, which allow you to provide a report to your peers or superiority about an incident you worked on.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
