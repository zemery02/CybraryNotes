                      <li>Bridges</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                </ul>
              <li value="3">Evaluates network traffic and performance</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>Most of your time spent as a network engineer will be monitoring network traffic and performance. Some of the tools that can help you do this include, but are not limited to: </li>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Wireshark</li>
                      <li>SolarWinds</li>
                      <li>Capsa</li>
                    </ul>
                  <li>Basically you are just monitoring the packets that are coming through your network to make sure they aren't taking too long to get to the people who need them.
                      You will also be monitoring what's inside of the packet to make sure that it is nothing that breaks company policy, or even the law.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              <li value="4">Performing backups</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>There are several different types of backups. The three that the lesson goes over are:
                    <ul>
                      <li>Incremental, which is a backup from the last change</li>
                      <li>Differential, which backs up everything since the last full backup</li>
                      <li>Full, which backs up everything on the network </li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>Most of the time, cost is the key factor in determining the type of backup you perform.</li>
                </ul>
              <li value="5">Follows regulations and policies</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>Just make sure that you are aware of company rules, and local and federal laws, so that you don't do anything that you're not supposed to.</li>
                </ul>
              <li value="6">Maintains the security of the network</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>Make sure you are following all of the following things:
                    <ul>
                      <li>C.I.A., which stands for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availibility</li>
                      <li>Data Loss Prevention, or DLP, which essentially means, making sure that if your network was breached, it would be hard to actually steal data. You can also perform backups, so that data is never truly lost.</li>
                      <li>Owning a Firewall</li>
                      <li>Owning antivirus/antimalware software for host systems and on servers</li>
                      <li>Owning IDS/IPS, which stands for Intrusion Detection System and Intrusion Prevention System</li>
                      <li>Owning a Honeypot, which can be used to monitor what data criminal hackers are going after</li>
                      <li>Network Segementation, or dividing your network up, so that its harder to access the data coming and going across the network</li>
                      <li>Seperation of duties, which can include checking in with someone, or having them use a personal key along with yours to access certain things, like servers, or data going across the network</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                </ul>
              <li value="7">Performing troubleshooting</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>While you can perform physical actions to do any needed troubleshooting, here are some virtual tools you can use to acomplish the same task:
                    <ul>
                      <li>The ping command can allow you to see where the problem in your connectivity is</li>
                      <li>tracert/traceroute can also allow you to see where a connectivity problem might be located</li>
                      <li>The ipconfig/ifconfig commandcan allow you to see the ip address, and/or the MAC address</li>
                      <li>The nslookup command can allow you to obtain the domain name or ip address</li>
                      <li>The netstat command is another tool you can use for several different tasks when performing troubleshooting</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                </ul>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>Typically a network engineer can work just about anywhere, but the most common places they work are:
            <ul>
              <li>The financial industry, which includes insurance companies as well as banks</li>
              <li>The healthcare industry, like urgent cares, emergency rooms, and other various places where patient information needs to be kept confidential</li>
              <li>The manufacturing industry, most of the network engineering done for a manufacturing company is outsourced, so most of the time you won't find a job for one specific manufacturing company</li>
              <li>The technology industry, where data can be more valuable than money at times, so it needs to be protected, as well as streamlined</li>
              <li>The government, which has enormous amounts of private data that needs to be kept from the public</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Most of the time, a network engineer will be working in an office enviroment.</li>
          <li>You'll want to have a bachelor's degree in either Computer Networking, or Computer Science, but you can certainly get a job with certifications like:
            <ul>
              <li>Network+</li>
              <li>CCNA</li>
              <li>MTA Networking Fundementals</li>
              <li>AWS</li>
              <li>Azure</li>
              <li>Google Cloud</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Salaries for a network engineer can vary widely, but an entry-level job can net you somewhere around $50-60,000.
              Once you get some more experience, the average salary is about $70-85,000, but high-level network engineers can make up to $120,000.
          </li>
          <li>The network engineer job is growing at about the saem rate as the sysAdmin, and the growth is just about as steady as a sysAdmin as well.</li>
