# This is my first repo

As the header reads, this is my first repository, so some things went a little awry.
You might have been able to tell from some of my commits that I had some problems.
I had 2 random files created called git branch, and s. I'm almost positive these
were created because I did not know to hit the Q key after typing the git log command.
