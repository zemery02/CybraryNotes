      <h2>Q&A</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>On a question about finding a job if you have a history of grey area in your resume: Find any potential work that you've done that isn't law-abiding, and put it into simpler terms that will
            not raise any alarms to any recruiters.
        </li>
        <li>On a question about how to prepare for a job that covers many smaller roles of the distinct jobs talked about in the course: Make sure that you are adaptible,
            so that you can handle the stress this situation could put you in. Also make sure thaat you continue to learn the bits and pieces of jobs that you need to learn, even if it's not on the clock,
            or something that you learn real-time on the job.
        </li>
        <li>On a question about the instructors' favorite IT/Security news sources: You can configure a Google news dock to present you with that sort of content, theres also a magazine called 2600,
            and a podcast named risky business that are also great sources of content. There is also The Hacker News as well as Dark Reading.
        </li>
        <li>On a question about diversity and difficulty starting out in the cybersecurity field: While the cybersecurity field is found all around the globe,
            currently there is a large gap between men and women in the cybersecurity field. however, there are some good initiatives out there attempting to close that gap in the future.
            As long as you are willing to put in the work, getting a job in cybersecurity is not too hard because of the massive need for more people in the field. Once you get a job, so long as you can perform some basic tasks,
            you can learn some valuable information on the job.
        </li>
        <li>On a question about finding an IT job outside of a metropolitan area without relocating: You can try to find a project manager position, and find opportunities to do IT work,
            but overall you should try to be flexible about relocation because there isn't much to do about this unique problem.
        </li>
        <li>On a question about whether you should list every job that you've had before cybersecurity: No you shouldn't, this is because cybersecurity is a niche job and if the skills aren't directly transferrable to the job
            you're applying for, you're just wasting the recruiter's time.
        </li>
        <li>On a question about who is responsible for securing Cloud storage: Both the data owner and the data provider should take the necessary steps in protecting any sort of data that may be stored in the Cloud.</li>
