    <div id="partOne">
      <h2>Part One: Prerequisites</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The only prerequisites to becoming a pentester is a computer, and a basic understanding of the vocabulary used in IT & Cybersecurity.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div id="partTwo">
      <h2>Part Two: Titles and Skillz</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Pentesting is a lot like the virtual version of robbing a bank. You have to be aware of every possible weakness in a business, both virtually and physically,
            and you have to know how to attack it in a way that the business wasn't ready for.
        </li>
        <li>Some of the things a pentester has to do when emulating a threat is:
          <ol>
            <li>Be aware of organzational weaknesses like bad/no policies, or untrained employees</li>
            <li>Be aware of physical weaknesses like no entry controls, or unlocked or unmonitored doors</li>
            <li>Be aware of any and all technological weaknesses</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>It's important to keep in mind that your day job as a pentester is breaking federal and international law. Naturally with that, comes a lot of paperwork so that you can perform your job with out being prosecuted.
          <ol>
            <li>Before you begin your work with a company, you will establish your scope of work, to make sure you don't go where you're not supposed, or see anything you're not supposed to see.
                As a way of shaking hands with the business, you will sign multiple NDAs or Non-Disclosure Agreements.
            </li>
            <li>Then, as you do your work, you provide extensive documentation to have evidence that you didn't break the NDA. You will also make sure that any action you perform will be able to be undone,
                so as to not accidently destroy critical part of a business.
            </li>
            <li>Once your finished with your work, you must provide a thorough report of anything you did or found that might be useful to the business.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>While there aren't too many official programs to become a pentester, there are plenty of certifications that you can earn to help you get jobs and/or contracts. Some of these certifications are:
          <ul>
            <li>CEH, which stands for Certified Ethical Hacker</li>
            <li>Pentest+, which is a CompTIA cert</li>
            <li>LPT, which stands for Licensed Penetration Tester</li>
            <li>OSCP, which stands for Offensive Security Certified Professional</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Another big part of becoming a pentester is an astronomical amount of practice.</li>
      </ul>

    <div id="partThree">
      <h2>Part Three: Salaries and Job Prospects</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Salary for a pentesting job can vary widely.</li>
        <li>Experience plays a large part in how much money you can make as a pentester.</li>
        <li>The median salary for pentesting is about $80,000. Entry-level will likely net you around $40-50,000, while 5 years experience can get you into the $120,000 range.</li>
        <li>Most companies do not employ a full-time pentester, meaning that most pentesters work off of contracts. While they can be very lucrative, they also push responsibilities onto you
            that you may not have worried about with non-contract work.
        </li>
        <li>Pentesting is one of the best jobs to be getting into currently. This field is experiencing 18-28% year-over-year job growth, which is one of the best rates for any job out there currently.</li>
        <li>The physical place you work can vary a lot. You can find a lot of remote jobs, meaning you can work from a home office, but you may also be working in an office enviroment if you happen to work for a firm.
            Depending on what's being asked of you, you could be working in a businesses store front to attempt to lift passwords off of people with conversational skills as well.

      <h2>Part Four: Tools</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>There are several models to follow when pentesting. We will go over the Phased pentesting model.
          <ol>
            <li>The first step is Reconnaissance. The example tool listed for this step is the Google-hacking-database.</li>
            <li>For the second step, you have Scanning, and the tool listed as an example for this is nmap.</li>
            <li>Next up you have Gaining Access, where you can create a reverse shell</li>
            <li>Then you have Maintaining Access, which scheduling jobs can help you out with</li>
            <li>Finally, you have Covering Tracks, which yo can do by clearing event logs and bash history.</li>
